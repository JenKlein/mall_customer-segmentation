# mall_customer-segmentation

## Background
For the past few years I've worked in marketing, either developing or analyzing targeted marketing campaigns. An important part of a successful marketing campaign is knowing your customer base well, so you know how to speak and relate to them. If you're building a campaign targeting millions of people, obviously you can't customize for every single person, so instead you group people based on similarities. I'd worked with customer segments when developing marketing campaigns, but I was curious to see how segmentation worked, so I followed along [Nehla's blog post](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/customer-segmentation-using-python-e56c2b1a4c73) on segmenting mall customers using K-Means clustering. Check out my [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/JenKlein/mall_customer-segmentation/blob/main/Customer_segmentation.ipynb) to see some beautiful visualizations!
